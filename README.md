# drawingEmotions

Final project outline for class [Drawing on the Web](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring20/CSCI-UA.0380-001/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is focusing on difficult emotions we, humans, process. The initial page contains a poem that leads to a journey that explore different emotional themes. As the user choses one theme at a time, she enters an experience enhanced with a personal voice message from me. The user is taken through a series of visuals which animate the emotional experience enhanced by both visuals and sound.


Using css and js, a variety of media such as videos, gifs, and audio, is layered to form a continuous sequence that mimics storytelling. The narrative is carried by human voice which helps personalize the affect of the experience. The intention for this project is to offer an exploratory experience and experimentation with the affect of visuals and sound on an individual level.
