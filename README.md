# drawingEmotions

Final project outline for class [Drawing on the Web](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring20/CSCI-UA.0380-001/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project utilizes audio-visual components to describe difficult emotions we, humans, process. The initial page contains a poem. The rows of the poem serve as links that lead to different emotional themes. This way, she enters an experience enhanced with a personal voice narration.

The project contains a variety of media such as videos, gifs, and audio. Stored in AWS S3 bucket, the media content is pulled using js. Visuals and audio are layered, displayed, and controled using css. The narrative is carried by human voice which helps personalize the affect of the experience. The intention for this project is to offer an exploratory experience and experimentation with the affect of visuals and sound on an individual level.
